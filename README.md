### introduction
my name is connor! my pronouns are he/him. i used to be part of FRC team 6918.

i've been involved in programming since i was about 10. i started with making games on scratch, and FOSS is something that i'm really passionate about.

i don't do as much programming as a used to, because i've been focused on school, but it's still a huge passion of mine!
