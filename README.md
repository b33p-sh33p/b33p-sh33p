## hello! ðŸ‘‹

### introduction
my name is connor, aka b33p-sh33p!

:transgender_symbol: i go by he/him pronouns.

:school: i don't really have any official qualifications or anything, i'm a minor and nowhere near college. however, working with computers has been a big interest of mine since i was about 10!

if you're going to  be working or interacting with me or anything, here's some things you should know:
- :infinity: i am on the autism spectrum. please have a bit of patience with me, especially if you are neurotypical.
- :rainbow_flag: i am part of the lgbtq+ community (transmasc). i will not tolerate homophobia (or any sort of bigotry, for that matter).
