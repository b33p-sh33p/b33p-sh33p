:speech_balloon: if you need to reach me, i am available on discord at `b33p sh33p#1787`

:school: i don't really have any special qualifications or anything, i'm only 14 and nowhere near college. however, developing stuff on computers has been a big interest of mine since i was about 10!

if you're going to  be working or interacting with me or anything, here's some things you should know:
- :infinity: i am on the autism spectrum (diagnosed at age 11). please have a bit of patience with me, especially if you are neurotypical.
- :rainbow_flag: i am part of the lgbtq+ community (transmasc & aroace). i will not tolerate homophobia (or any bigotry, for that matter).
